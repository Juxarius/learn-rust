The Halloween Doodle in 2000
featured a special new element - animation!
The O’s disguised as Jack-o-lanterns featured some
haunting flashing lights as well as an 8-legged friend.
From this moment on, animation would become a key element
of Doodle storytelling!

The Doodle for Google contest invites K-12 students to
try their hand at drawing a Doodle—and compete to see it
live on the Google homepage. Now the longest running
Google contest, Doodle for Google celebrates young artists
and the power of creativity.
A celebration of the beloved game Pac-Man and the first
interactive Doodle game experience!
Play to see if you can get a high score—no quarters needed!
